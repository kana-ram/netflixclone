# 📺 Netflix Clone

A fully responsive Netflix front-end clone built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project replicates key UI and UX aspects of Netflix, such as category rows, a video player modal, hero banner, and a personal watchlist — all built with no frameworks.

> 🗓 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **2022**, but due to an issue with my previous GitHub account being disabled, it is being published here now in **2025**.
